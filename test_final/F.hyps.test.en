Language, literature, theatrical arts, image, architecture, crafts, art and broadcasting are all part of cultural diversity in Europe.
The European Union has two objectives: Maintaining and supporting this diversity and making it available to others.
Cultural industries in the EU – cinema and audiovisual industry, publishing, music industries and crafts – are all important sources of revenue and job providers, providing about seven million people.
The Union has economic responsibility for this area and seeks to ensure the right conditions for European industry to be competitive at international level.
Thus, the EU has launched programmes to support certain branches of cultural industries, encouraging them to exploit the opportunities offered by the common market and digital technologies.
The EU also seeks to create a dynamic environment for these industries by facilitating access to finance, contributing to research projects and encouraging cooperation with Union internal and external partners.
The Union will also involve the cultural dimension in many other policies such as education (including language learning), research, support for new technologies and information society and social and regional development.
For example, the European Social Fund (ESF) is supported by the Italian Arturo Toscanini Foundation, which has organised courses for the unemployed for the unemployed since the mid-1990s.
The specific objectives of the current cultural programme are to promote awareness at European level of key cultural objects and to promote their preservation; promoting transnational mobility of workers in the cultural sector; encouraging transnational dissemination of works and cultural and artistic works; encouraging intercultural dialogue.
The MEDIA programmes aimed at making the European audiovisual sector more dynamic and competitive have been working since the mid-1990s.
Each year, one of the two cities will be selected as European Capitals of Culture and will give them the right to receive financial support.
Linguistic diversity is a cornerstone of the European Union's culture and democracy.
The language not only opens the door to other cultures, but also gives us the opportunity to get to other countries when travelling or working in other countries.
It is estimated that 40 million people in the EU speak language, which is not the country's country of origin.
The CAP aims to ensure a reasonable standard of living for farmers, to provide consumers with a fair price for high-quality food and to preserve our soil.
Over the first wave of reforms, the cattle and gymnastics and dairy lakes are already in the past twenty years.
Our main source of information and entertainment is television.
Every one of us is putting on average three hours a day news, sports transmissions, movies and other shows.
The government of each Member State has its audiovisual policy, while the Union lays down rules and guidelines for common interests, such as the EU and open borders and fair competition.
In order to protect its cultural diversity and to promote local products, the EU World Trade Organisation requested a & quot; cultural derogation & quot; which succeeded in achieving.
Due to the speed of technological innovation, broadcasting and telecommunications have approached each other.
Open borders and transport at affordable prices have provided Europeans with unprecedented personal freedom of movement.
Goods are transported quickly and efficiently from the factory to consumers who are often in different countries.
The European Union has contributed to the opening up of the internal market to competition and removing physical and technical barriers to mobility.
However, current transport models and growth rates are not sustainable.
The ability of people and goods to drive, efficiently and cheaply, is the guiding principle of the EU's dynamic economy and a cohesive society.
The removal of barriers to cross-border trade and travel has increased the volume of long-distance transport of goods and passengers.
Although many aspects of transport policy fall within the scope of the Member States, it is reasonable if there is a single transport infrastructure in the common European market.
Over the last ten years, the EU has opened national transport markets for competition across the Union, in particular road and air transport and less rail transport.
As a result, lorries can also take other goods in other countries, so that they do not return to international voyages.
Road transport is now transported by 44% of all goods in the EU, with 39% transported short sea shipping, 10% railways and 34% inland waterways.
The transfer of freight and passenger transport from road transport to less polluting modes of transport is a key factor in any sustainable transport policy.
The European Union (EU) is a family of democratic European countries committed to cooperation for peace and prosperity.
The EU is not a country that should replace the existing countries, as well as the organisation of international cooperation.
The historic beginnings of the Union go back to World War II.
The idea was therefore because Europeans decided to avoid a recurrence of such slaughter and destruction.
Six countries cooperated in the early years and mainly in trade and economy.
The 27 countries of the EU and 490 million people are now involved, and it deals with many different issues that are directly important for our everyday lives.
Europe is a continent of many different traditions and languages, but it also has common values, such as democracy, freedom and social justice.
In the world of the 21st century, which states increasingly depend on each other, it is increasingly necessary for every European citizen to cooperate in a spirit of openness, openness and solidarity with people in other countries.
You can travel through the majority of the EU without passport and without stopping you from border control.
The EU's story as a ten step from the Schuman Declaration and six Member States in the 1950s until enlargement and 27 Member States.
On 9 May 1950, the Schuman Declaration was proposed to establish a European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which would be the Paris Agreement of 18 April 1951.
The customs duties between six countries were cancelled on 1 July 1968, and common policies were introduced in the 1960s, in particular trade and agricultural policy.
In June 1979, a decisive step was made for the European Community as the first direct and general elections of the European Parliament took place.
The European political shape marked a significant change in the Berlin Wall in 1989.
In March 2000, the EU adopted the Lisbon Strategy for modernising the European economy and enabling it to compete with other key players in the world market, such as the USA and the new industrialised countries.
The traveler has so much to discover and the European Union has made it much easier.
You can cross the EU without checking many borders and the euro makes it easier to purchase.
The Green Card is not mandatory when travelling in the EU, but it is an internationally recognised insurance certificate and facilitates compliance with the requirements of accidents.
The creation of a single European market in air transport has meant lower fares and a wider choice of airlines and services to passengers.
There are 210 000 km of railways in the EU where various international passenger services are offered.
A number of countries have high-speed train lines, speeds up to 300 km / h and this year will extend the network to new connections in Belgium, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
Latvia on the shores of the Baltic Sea is low land with large forests, where the construction and paper industries are to be deployed.
Latvia is also producing consumer and textile goods and working tools.
Ethnic population consists of 59% of Latvians and 29% of the Russians and over a third of the population living in Riga.
Riga is the largest city in the Baltic States, which is 730 000.
The Latvian Parliament is elected by direct universal suffrage every four years.
The President shall elect Parliament and every four years.
The typical dishes of the Latvian kitchen are bacon pies and cold refreshing sauces.

“Knowledge is a key factor for competitiveness ”, said Janez Potočnik, European Commissioner for Research.
If our companies have to play a leading role in the future, they must invest in knowledge now and governments must take appropriate measures to help them.
The EU is a part of a globalised world where knowledge is more evenly distributed than ever.
Nuclear fusion offers an opportunity to produce almost unlimited amounts of clean energy over a long period of time.
The low level of private research and development spending in Europe compared to the US is mainly due to differences in industrial structure and that Europe's high-tech industry is less.
As far as science is concerned, although the EU is the world's largest creator of scientific knowledge, the impact of European science is less than the US science.
Europe is lagging behind in all the scientific disciplines of the USA, in terms of the impact of quotes and the number of jobs quoted.
The EU universities are also very underrepresented in the forefront of the ranking of the world ’ s largest universities bibliometric indicators.
Moreover, the link between technology (patented inventions) and science base in the EU is much weaker than the US.
Europe has a difficult breakthrough in the new high-tech industry.
Today, the new discovery of R & amp; D funding was launched when the European Commission adopted proposals to launch the first EU-wide public-private partnership for research and development.
In order to ensure our competitiveness and prosperity, Europe needs a new approach to science in certain promising areas.
It is in areas where funding for research at national, European and industrial level provides much less added value, creating favourable conditions for greater funding for research and development.
Invisible computers (embedded computing systems) nowadays run all machines from cars, planes and phones, from energy networks and factories to washing machines and televisions.
It is predicted that over 16 billion embedded systems exist in 2010 and over 40 billion devices exist worldwide by 2020.
By 2010, these invisible chips account for 30 to 40% of the value of new products in consumer electronics (41%), telecommunications (37%), automotive (36%) and medical devices (33%).
The Innovative Medicines Initiative will support the development of new knowledge, equipment and methods to allow faster and safer use of medicines.
The European Commission is currently presenting its ideas on the European Research Area, which represents most of the potential of European knowledge.
The Commission's aim is to put in place effective action to enable people, infrastructure, organisations, funding sources, knowledge exchange and global cooperation.
The more efficient and efficient use of knowledge is essential if the EU wants to achieve its economic, social and social objectives, listed in the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs.
Our future depends on whether Europe can truly become a truly knowledge-based society.
The European Research Area is the basis for a knowledge-based society.
Business businesses are difficult to create partnerships with universities, especially in other countries.
Researchers are still facing obstacles to development or other EU research.
National and regional funding for research is largely uncoordinated and thus ineffective.
The use of research results could be significantly improved.
The document is accompanied by guidelines which help research institutions to improve links with industry, highlighting good practice in the management and exchange of knowledge and intellectual property.
A sufficient number of competent researchers who are very mobile between institutions, disciplines, sectors and countries are one of the main axes.
The aim of the directive is to achieve a good level of quality of all rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and groundwater in the European Union by 2015.

Businesses will be directly involved in research and education, thereby contributing to supporting entrepreneurial mindsets among graduates and researchers.
The European Commission has now taken the view that European universities best modernise.
European universities have enormous potential, a large part of which remains unexploited because of inflexibility and various obstacles.
The release of large knowledge, talent and energy supplies requires a change, a comprehensive, coordinated and coordinated change: From the way in which systems are regulated and managed.
While universities train and teach millions of people every year, there are still many obstacles in European higher education systems, many of which are decades old.
Universities are the driving force for creating knowledge.
Universities need to adapt to the demands of a global, knowledge-based economy, the same way to adapt to other sectors of society and economy.
Each institution should find a balance between education, research and innovation, which is suited to its role in its region or in the country best.
The aim is to create a framework in which colleges can become stronger participants in a global knowledge society and economy.
The Commission is ready to support the modernisation of EU universities through the process of identifying and sharing good practice and through its education, research and innovation funding programmes.
The European Commission has identified 9 areas in which changes should be made in such a way that European universities can contribute to the creation of a true knowledge-based economy.
One of the proposals is to allow students to use national loans and subsidies throughout the EU where they decide to learn or to do science.
We must change national education and support schemes so that the best students can participate in higher education and continue research careers regardless of their background.
We need to change university funding systems in order to focus more on the outcome and allow universities greater responsibility for their own long-term financial sustainability, especially in research.
We must allow universities more autonomy and responsibility to react quickly to changes.
This could include a revision of curricula for adapting them to new developments, introducing closer links between research areas and focusing on specific research areas (e.g. renewable energy, nanotechnology).
It may also include greater autonomy at the level of a specific institution in the selection and selection of researchers.
In all EU Member States, seatbelts must now be fastened in all vehicles, including tourist buses and buses.
